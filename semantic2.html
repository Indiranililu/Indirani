        <p>Milkybar, called Galak in Continental Europe and Latin America, is a white chocolate confection produced by Nestlé since 1936 and sold worldwide (not sold in the US, although it may be ordered online for delivery, or found in specialty candy shops).[1] According to Nestlé, Milkybar/Galak contains no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives.[1] In Australia and New Zealand, Milkybar does not contain cocoa butter, and is therefore not labelled as chocolate.[2]

            The Galak brand was launched by Nestlé (at the time Nestlé-Peter-Cailler-Kohler) amidst strong competition within the Swiss chocolate market. It was the first white chocolate brand.[3]</p>
